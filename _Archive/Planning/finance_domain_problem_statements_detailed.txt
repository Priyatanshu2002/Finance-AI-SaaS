  Sub-Domain: CIM / Offering Memorandum Creation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Manual CIM (Confidential Information Memorandum) Creation is Extremely
  Time-Intensive

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Creating a CIM involves weeks of manual data gathering, copy-pasting from
  multiple sources, formatting, financial summarization, and iterative
  revisions. Junior analysts spend 60-70% of their time on mechanical tasks
  like data entry and formatting rather than strategic work. A single CIM can
  take 2-6 weeks to finalize and 10-40 hours of manual review/validation alone.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • IB Analysts
  • IB Associates
  • Managing Directors
  • Sell-side Advisory Teams

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
  1. Gather data from client materials, public filings, management presentations

  PS-002 | Investment Banking — Deal Execution
  Sub-Domain: Pitchbook & Presentation Creation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Pitchbook Creation Consumes Disproportionate Analyst Hours on Formatting

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Creating and formatting pitchbooks involves manually updating charts with
  latest market data, ensuring consistent fonts/colors/branding, and pulling
  data points from multiple terminals (Bloomberg, CapIQ, FactSet). Banks like
  Goldman Sachs and Barclays have tried internal automation but it remains
  largely manual. Analysts spend 6-8 hours daily in Excel/PowerPoint doing
  this work.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  PS-003 | Investment Banking — Deal Origination
  Sub-Domain: Deal Sourcing & Target Screening
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Deal Sourcing Relies on Fragmented Manual Research Across Disconnected Systems

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Bankers manually scan news, filings, industry reports, and their personal
  networks to identify M&A targets. There is no 'single source of truth' for
  relationship data — information is scattered across spreadsheets, CRMs,
  emails, and handwritten notes. Critical relationship context is lost when
  personnel leave the firm.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • Managing Directors
  • Vice Presidents
  • Business Development Teams

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
  1. Monitor news and industry publications manually
  2. Search CapIQ/PitchBook databases with manual filters

  PS-004 | Transaction Advisory — M&A
  Sub-Domain: Due Diligence
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Financial & Legal Due Diligence is Overwhelmingly Manual Document Review

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Due diligence requires reviewing thousands of documents (contracts, financial
  statements, legal filings, employee records) in virtual data rooms. Analysts
  manually extract key terms, flag risks, cross-reference data, and compile
  findings into reports. A single M&A deal may involve 10,000-50,000 documents
  taking weeks of manual review.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • Transaction Advisory Teams
  • Legal Counsel
  • Buy-side Analysts
  • Accounting/Audit Teams

CURRENT WORKFLOW:

  PS-005 | Investment Banking — Financial Analysis
  Sub-Domain: Financial Modeling
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Financial Models in Excel are Error-Prone, Unstandardized, and Maintenance-Heavy

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  94% of business spreadsheets contain critical errors. IB analysts spend 6-8
  hours daily in Excel, with a significant portion on model maintenance
  (updating data, fixing formulas, reformatting) rather than analysis. Models
  grow to 100MB+ with broken links, hardcoded values, and inconsistent
  formatting. No standardization across teams leads to confusion and audit risk.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • IB Analysts
  • Financial Modelers
  • Valuation Teams
  • Audit/Compliance

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
  1. Build DCF/LBO/merger models from scratch or templates

  PS-006 | Investment Banking — Financial Analysis
  Sub-Domain: Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Spreading Comps is a Tedious Manual Exercise Despite Available Data Tools

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Despite having CapIQ, FactSet, and Bloomberg, banks still require analysts to
  manually pull, adjust, and format comparable company multiples because of the
  need for precision, custom adjustments (calendarization, non-recurring items),
  and firm-specific methodologies. This is one of the most cited 'grunt work'
  tasks by junior bankers.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • IB Analysts
  • Equity Research Associates

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
  1. Identify peer universe manually from industry knowledge
  2. Pull raw financial data from CapIQ/FactSet/Bloomberg

  Sub-Domain: Commercial Real Estate Underwriting
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  CRE Underwriting is Trapped in Complex, Error-Prone Excel Spreadsheets

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Commercial real estate underwriting involves building complex pro forma models
  in Excel with lease-by-lease analysis, expense projections, debt sizing, and
  return calculations. 88% of spreadsheets contain errors. Underwriters manually
  input in-place lease data, re-leasing assumptions, expense budgets, and sale
  assumptions. Each property type (multifamily, office, retail, industrial)
  requires different model structures.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • CRE Underwriters
  • Acquisitions Analysts
  • Lenders
  • Equity Investors

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
  1. Receive offering memorandum and rent roll from broker
  2. Manually input property details and in-place lease information

  PS-008 | Real Estate Finance
  Sub-Domain: Property Due Diligence & Document Management
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Real Estate Transaction Documentation is Overwhelmingly Paper-Based and
  Fragmented

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Real estate deals generate massive documentation — contracts, property
  disclosures, environmental reports, title documents, zoning approvals, loan
  applications, appraisals. Managing these manually across email, shared drives,
  and physical files leads to delays, lost documents, and compliance risks.
  Mortgage approvals alone can be delayed by weeks due to manual document
  workflows.

WHO SUFFERS:

  • Title Companies
  • Lenders
  • Property Managers
  • Investors

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Project Finance Models are Extremely Complex with Limited Tooling Beyond Excel

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  Project finance models involve complex debt sculpting, multiple currencies,
  construction drawdown schedules, concession timelines, and regulatory tariff
  structures. Excel limitations (circular references for interest, file size,

  Very few specialized tools exist — the industry is underserved compared to
  corporate finance.

WHO SUFFERS:
  • Project Finance Bankers
  • Infrastructure Fund Analysts
  • Development Finance Institutions
  • Government PPP Teams

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
  1. Build bespoke Excel models with 50-100+ tabs

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROBLEM TITLE:
  Know Your Customer/Business Processes are Slow, Manual, and Fraud-Vulnerable

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  KYC/KYB onboarding involves lengthy manual checks across fragmented data
  sources — company registries, sanctions lists, PEP databases, and beneficial
  ownership records. This delays revenue, frustrates partners, and legacy manual
  approaches cannot detect increasingly sophisticated fraud techniques. A single
  institutional client onboarding can take 4-8 weeks.
